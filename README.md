# arcade-multi-events

A MakeCode Arcade extension that makes it easier to create events for multiple sprite kinds at once.

This extension gives you new versions of all of the normal sprite events:

* on created
* on destroyed
* on overlap
* on overlap tile
* on hit wall

Except now you can pass multiple sprite kinds at once instead of just one! And, in the case of on overlap tile, more than one tile as well!

But that's not all! This extension also gives you an extra version of each block which can be used locally. Now you can define your events using a loop!
